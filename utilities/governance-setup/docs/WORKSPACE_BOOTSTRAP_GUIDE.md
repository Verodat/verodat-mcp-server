# Workspace Bootstrap Guide - Operations Governance

## Overview
A revolutionary approach to workspace initialization using RAIDA-driven bootstrapping. The entire governance framework is established through just TWO manual steps, with everything else automated and governed.

## The Two-Step Bootstrap

### Step 1: Create Core_RAIDA Dataset ‚úÖ
**Status**: COMPLETED (Dataset ID: 5568)
- This is the ONLY ungoverned action
- Creates the foundation for tracking all future actions

### Step 2: Load Bootstrap Entry ‚úÖ  
**Status**: COMPLETED (RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP loaded)
- Single RAIDA entry that triggers entire framework setup
- References workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json
- Executes PROC-BOOTSTRAP-WORKSPACE

## What Happens Next

When RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP is executed, PROC-BOOTSTRAP-WORKSPACE automatically:

1. **Loads the Bootstrap Bundle** (workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json)
2. **Verifies Existing Datasets** (already created in our case)
3. **Loads Policies** into Business_Policies_Ops
4. **Loads Procedures** into AI_Agent_Procedures_Ops  
5. **Configures Agents** in AI_Agent_Identity_Ops
6. **Initializes Registry** in AI_Data_Model_Registry
7. **Creates RAIDA Entries** for each action (self-documenting)
8. **Activates AGENT-RAIDA-OPS** for continuous change logging
9. **Enables Full Governance** - all future changes are tracked

## Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed
- Core_RAIDA dataset created (ID: 5568)
- workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json created with all components
- PROC-BOOTSTRAP-WORKSPACE added to procedures
- RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP entry loaded in Core_RAIDA

### üìã Ready to Execute
The bootstrap is ready. When you execute RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP:
- All policies will be loaded automatically
- All procedures will be configured
- All agents will be created
- Full governance will be activated
- AGENT-RAIDA-OPS will ensure continuous logging

### üéØ Next Actions
1. **Promote Core_RAIDA to PUBLISHED** (with bootstrap entry)
2. **Promote PROC-BOOTSTRAP-WORKSPACE to PUBLISHED**
3. **Execute RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP** (marks it as "In Progress")
4. **System automatically completes setup**
5. **Mark RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP as "Done"**

## The Magic

After bootstrap:
- **Every change is logged** - AGENT-RAIDA-OPS creates RAIDA entries automatically
- **Full governance active** - All operations follow procedures
- **Self-sustaining** - System maintains itself through governance
- **Reproducible** - Same process works for any new workspace

## Key Innovation: From Manual to Automated

### Traditional Approach (11+ manual steps):
1. Create each dataset manually
2. Add each policy manually
3. Add each procedure manually
4. Configure each agent manually
5. Set up registry manually
6. Activate governance manually
...and hope nothing was missed

### Our Approach (2 steps):
1. Create Core_RAIDA
2. Load bootstrap ‚Üí Everything else automatic

## Bootstrap Bundle Contents

The `workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json` contains:
- **5 Dataset definitions** (already exist, so verified only)
- **3 Core Policies** (governance, dataset management, coordination)
- **4 Core Procedures** (including bootstrap itself)
- **5 Specialist Agents** (including RAIDA-OPS for logging)
- **1 Bootstrap RAIDA** entry to trigger everything

## Benefits

1. **Minimized Manual Work**: Only 2 manual actions vs 11+
2. **Early Governance**: Activated at step 3 (earliest possible)
3. **Complete Automation**: Single procedure handles everything
4. **Full Audit Trail**: Every action creates RAIDA entry
5. **Reproducible**: Same bundle works for any workspace
6. **Self-Documenting**: RAIDA log shows exact setup sequence
7. **Error Prevention**: Automated = no human errors
8. **Time Saving**: Minutes instead of hours

## For Future Workspaces

To bootstrap a new workspace:

```
1. Create Core_RAIDA dataset
2. Copy workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json
3. Load RAIDA-BOOTSTRAP entry
4. Execute bootstrap
5. Done - fully governed workspace ready
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL: Field Mapping Requirements

**IMPORTANT**: Verodat's default mapping is CASE-SENSITIVE and requires EXACT field name matches!

### Field Naming Rules:
- **Use lowercase with underscores**: `policy_id` NOT `Policy_Id`
- **No spaces in field names**: `policy_owner` NOT `Policy Owner`  
- **Headers must match target fields exactly**: The column headers in your upload data MUST match the dataset's target field names character-for-character
- **Case matters**: `policy` ‚â† `Policy` ‚â† `POLICY`

### Example of Correct Headers:
```json
{
  "header": [
    { "name": "policy_id", "type": "string" },       // ‚úÖ Correct
    { "name": "policy_owner", "type": "string" },    // ‚úÖ Correct
    { "name": "Policy_Id", "type": "string" },       // ‚ùå Wrong case
    { "name": "Policy Owner", "type": "string" }     // ‚ùå Has space
  ]
}
```

### Why This Matters:
If field names don't match exactly, the default mapping will fail silently and your data won't be uploaded correctly. This applies to ALL data uploads, including:
- Policies into Business_Policies_Ops
- Procedures into AI_Agent_Procedures_Ops
- Agents into AI_Agent_Identity_Ops
- RAIDA entries into Core_RAIDA

Always check the exact field names in the target dataset before uploading!

## Technical Notes

- **Assignee**: "verodat" for all system tasks
- **Source References**: Bundle contains all definitions
- **Governance Activation**: Happens during bootstrap execution
- **RAIDA Agent**: Ensures nothing happens without logging
- **Field Mapping**: Must use exact field names (case-sensitive)

## Summary

We've created a self-bootstrapping, self-governing, self-documenting system that reduces workspace initialization from a complex manual process to just two steps. The system then takes over, sets itself up, and maintains governance forever.

**The workspace is now ready for governed operations!**
