# Bootstrap Ready Checklist

## ‚úÖ Files and Configuration

### Bundle File
- [x] `workspace_bootstrap_bundle.json` exists (renamed from v2)
- [x] Contains VERA orchestration agent
- [x] Contains orchestration procedures (PROC-ORCHESTRATE-GOVERNANCE, etc.)
- [x] Contains POL-GOVERNANCE-OPTIMIZATION policy
- [x] Total: 9 policies, 11 procedures, 7 agents

### Bootstrap Script
- [x] `raida-bootstrap-interactive.cjs` updated
- [x] Generates Claude project instructions automatically
- [x] Saves instructions to docs directory
- [x] Displays instructions in console

### Core System
- [x] OrchestrationService implemented
- [x] AgentCommunicator created
- [x] GovernanceAnalyzer with 75% similarity detection
- [x] AgentLoader for loading agents from dataset
- [x] fallbackBehavior: 'orchestrate' configured
- [x] BaseToolHandler triggers orchestration for missing procedures

## üìã Bootstrap Process Ready

1. **Command to Run in Cline:**
   ```bash
   cd utilities/governance-setup/bootstrap
   ./run-interactive-bootstrap.sh
   ```

2. **What You'll Need:**
   - Verodat account credentials
   - Access to promote datasets (DRAFT ‚Üí PUBLISHED)
   - ~10 minutes for complete process

3. **Expected Results:**
   - 4 datasets created with IDs
   - All governance data loaded
   - Claude instructions generated
   - VERA orchestration active

## üß™ Testing Plan After Bootstrap

### Test 1: Verify Data Loaded
```bash
# Check datasets exist
node build/src/manage.js call get-datasets '{"accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT, "workspaceId": YOUR_WORKSPACE, "filter": "vstate=ACTIVE"}'

# Check procedures loaded
node build/src/manage.js call list-procedures '{}'
```

### Test 2: Test Orchestration Trigger
```bash
# Attempt a WRITE operation without a procedure
# This should trigger VERA orchestration
node build/src/manage.js call create-dataset '{"accountId": YOUR_ACCOUNT, "workspaceId": YOUR_WORKSPACE, "name": "Test_Dataset", "targetFields": [{"name": "id", "type": "string", "mandatory": true}]}'
```

Expected: System should either:
- Find existing procedure and execute
- Trigger VERA to create new governance
- Guide you through policy/procedure creation

### Test 3: Claude Integration
1. Copy generated instructions to Claude project
2. Test POL-CLAUDE-CONFIG loads correctly
3. Verify procedures are available

## üöÄ You're Ready to Bootstrap!

All components are in place:
- ‚úÖ Bundle file contains VERA orchestration
- ‚úÖ Script generates Claude instructions
- ‚úÖ Orchestration system implemented
- ‚úÖ Instructions document created

**Next Step:** Start a new Cline task and paste the command from BOOTSTRAP_CLINE_INSTRUCTIONS.md

## üìù Notes

- The bootstrap will include the new VERA orchestration system
- Missing procedures will trigger governance creation instead of blocking
- POL-GOVERNANCE-OPTIMIZATION ensures no duplicate governance
- Claude instructions will be minimal (just IDs and policy reference)

## üéØ Success Criteria

After bootstrap and testing, you should see:
1. VERA agent creating governance when procedures are missing
2. New policies/procedures stored in datasets
3. Operations proceeding with newly created governance
4. No more "PROC-EXPORT-DATA-V1" fallback issues
